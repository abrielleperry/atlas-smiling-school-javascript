[Page hosted here](https://abrielleperry.github.io/atlas-smiling-school-javascript/)

## Project Overview

For this project, I utilized my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Accessibility, Responsive Design, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The objective was to create fully functional web pages that matched the design provided by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. 

## Objective

The main goal was to develop web pages that looked identical to the provided designer file. I had the freedom to implement the project in any way I saw fit, utilizing the skills I had learned.

## Design Reference

The design for the web pages was created by Nicolas Philippot. I could find the final screens [here](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool-webstack/623/Archive.zip).

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Codebase**: I started by downloading the zip from this [codebase](https://intranet.atlasschool.com/rltoken/TV15_xBJLHluq5jqTy8oXg).
2. **Clone the Repository**: I cloned the repository to my local machine.
   ```
   git clone <my-repository-url>
   ```

## Project Requirements

- **HTML/CSS**: I ensured semantic HTML and well-structured CSS.
- **Accessibility**: I implemented accessibility best practices to make the web pages accessible to all users.
- **Responsive Design**: The web pages were responsive and worked well on various screen sizes.
- **Bootstrap**: I utilized Bootstrap components and grid system for faster development.
- **JavaScript**: I used JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic functionality.

## Instructions

- There were minimal instructions provided. I was free to approach the implementation in my own way.
- I referred to the designer file and ensured that my web pages visually matched the design.
- I used the provided link to fork the codebase and started working on my project.
